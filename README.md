## 🎯 How It Works

**Five simple steps to optimized streams:**

1. **📂 Select Groups** → Choose which channel groups to work with
2. **📺 Select Channels** → Pick specific channels (e.g., BBC One, ESPN)
3. **🔍 Search & Filter** → Find matching streams across all providers with customizable filters
4. **✅ Review & Add** → Preview results and select streams to add via checkboxes
5. **⚡ Analyze & Optimize** → Full ffmpeg quality probe, scoring, and ranking

**The result:** Your channels contain the optimal streams in the optimal order for Dispatcharr's failover behavior.

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- ✅ **Docker and docker-compose** installed on your server
- ✅ **Dispatcharr** running on the same Docker network
- ✅ **Dispatcharr credentials** (username and password)

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

Get up and running in minutes:

```bash
# 1. Download the latest release
wget https://github.com/Biggregw/dispatcharr-maid/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
unzip main.zip && cd dispatcharr-maid-main

# 2. Configure your credentials
cp .env.example .env
nano .env  # Add your Dispatcharr URL, username, and password

# 3. Start the containers
docker-compose up -d

# 4. Access the web interface
# Open http://YOUR-SERVER-IP:5000 in your browser
```

**🎉 That's it!** You should see the Dispatcharr Maid dashboard.

## 🔧 Stream Selection, Enrichment, and Ranking

### How Dispatcharr-Maid Works

**Dispatcharr-Maid works from your existing Dispatcharr channel configuration.**

For a given channel, it reads the current list of provider streams already associated with that channel and applies logic derived from the original channel name rather than relying on provider-specific naming alone.

Dispatcharr-Maid then **searches across all configured providers** in Dispatcharr to identify additional matching streams for the same channel. This enrichment step uses only streams that already exist within Dispatcharr and does not source content externally.

### Filtering and Selection

During stream selection and enrichment, you can apply rules such as:

- **Regional variants** - Include or exclude specific regions (e.g., "BBC One Yorkshire")
- **Device compatibility** - Filter for FireStick/Fire TV (excludes 4K streams that may buffer)
- **Custom filters** - Include/exclude patterns using wildcards (e.g., `york*`, `linc*`)

Before any changes are applied, a **manual review step** allows individual streams to be included or excluded using checkboxes—you have complete control.

### Quality Analysis and Ranking

Once streams are added back into the channel, Dispatcharr-Maid performs a **full ffmpeg probe** and analyzes streams based on factors such as:

- Technical quality (bitrate, codec, resolution)
- Stream reliability and responsiveness
- Connection speed and stability

Streams are then **ranked and reordered** within the channel.

### Configurable Stream Depth

Dispatcharr-Maid supports **configurable stream depth per provider**:

- Selecting **1** retains only the highest-ranked stream from each provider
- Selecting **2** retains the top two streams from each provider
- And so on...

### Optimal Stream Ordering

Streams are ordered so the **best stream from each provider appears first**, followed by the second-best stream from each provider, and so on.

**Example with 3 providers and depth = 2:**

```
Provider A #1, Provider B #1, Provider C #1, Provider A #2, Provider B #2, Provider C #2
```

This ordering **aligns perfectly with Dispatcharr's playback behavior**, allowing it to:

1. Attempt the highest-quality stream from each provider first
2. Fall back to the next provider if a stream fails
3. Try second-tier streams only after all top streams are exhausted

The result: **Maximum reliability with optimal quality.**

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

Running into issues? Here are some quick tips:

**Container won't start:**
```bash
docker-compose logs dispatcharr-maid
```

**Can't connect to Dispatcharr:**
```bash
# Make sure you're using the container name, not localhost
# In .env: DISPATCHARR_BASE_URL=http://dispatcharr:9191
docker exec dispatcharr-maid ping dispatcharr
```

**Web interface not accessible:**
```bash
# Check if the web container is running
docker-compose ps dispatcharr-maid-web

# Check if port 5000 is available
sudo netstat -tlnp | grep 5000
```
