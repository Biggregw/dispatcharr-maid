# This repository does not currently ship built-in authentication for the web UI.
# Keep the UI on a trusted network, or put it behind a reverse proxy (Nginx Proxy
# Manager, Caddy, Traefik) with authentication.
#
# If you want to customize your deployment (extra env vars, different ports,
# resource limits, etc.), you can add overrides here.
#
# Example:
#
# services:
#   dispatcharr-maid-web:
#     environment:
#       SOME_ENV_VAR: "value"
